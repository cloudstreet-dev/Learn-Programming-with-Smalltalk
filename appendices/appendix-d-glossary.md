# Appendix D: Glossary

A comprehensive reference of Smalltalk-specific terminology and concepts. All terms are defined in beginner-friendly language with cross-references to relevant chapters.

## A

**Abstract Class**
A class designed to be subclassed but not instantiated directly. It defines common behavior for its subclasses but leaves some methods unimplemented. Example: `Collection` is abstract; you use `Array` or `Set` instead. See Chapter 15.

**Accessor**
A method that provides access to an instance variable. There are two types: getters (return the value) and setters (change the value). Example: `name` and `name:`. See Chapter 12.

**Alan Kay**
Principal inventor of Smalltalk and the concept of object-oriented programming. Visionary behind the "everything is an object" philosophy. Winner of the Turing Award. See Chapter 1.

**Argument**
A value passed to a method or block when it's executed. Also called a "parameter." Example: in `3 + 4`, the `4` is an argument. See Chapters 4, 9.

**Array**
A fixed-size, ordered collection that can hold any objects. Created with `#( )` literal syntax or `Array new:`. Example: `#(1 2 3)`. See Chapter 6.

**Assignment**
The act of storing a value in a variable using `:=`. Example: `x := 42`. The `:=` is the assignment operator. See Chapter 7.

**Automatic Testing**
See **Unit Testing**.

## B

**Bag**
A collection that holds objects with duplicates allowed, optimized for counting occurrences. Like a multiset in mathematics. See Chapter 6.

**Baseline**
A Metacello configuration that defines package dependencies and load order for a project. Used for managing complex multi-package projects. See Chapter 26.

**Binary Message**
A message using an operator symbol like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `<`, `>`, `=`. Always takes exactly one argument. Example: `3 + 4`. See Chapter 4.

**Block**
A chunk of code enclosed in square brackets `[ ]` that can be stored, passed around, and executed later. Also called a **closure**. Example: `[ 2 + 2 ]`. See Chapter 9.

**Block Argument**
A parameter passed to a block when it executes. Declared with colons. Example: `[ :x | x * 2 ]` - here `:x` is the block argument. See Chapter 9.

**Boolean**
An object representing true or false. In Smalltalk, `true` and `false` are actual objects (instances of `True` and `False`). See Chapter 8.

**Browser**
See **System Browser**.

## C

**Cascade**
A way to send multiple messages to the same receiver using semicolons `;`. Example: `transcript show: 'Hello'; cr; show: 'World'`. Avoids repeating the receiver. See Chapter 4.

**Changes File**
A file (`.changes`) that logs every change you make to the code in an image. A complete history that allows recovery after crashes. See Chapter 17.

**Class**
A blueprint or template for creating objects. Defines the structure (instance variables) and behavior (methods) of its instances. Example: `Point`, `String`, `Array`. See Chapter 11.

**Class-side Method**
A method defined on the class itself rather than on instances. Used for creating instances or accessing class-level information. Example: `Date today`. See Chapter 11.

**Closure**
Another name for a **block**. Called "closure" because it closes over (captures) variables from its surrounding scope. See Chapter 9.

**Cog VM**
The modern, high-performance virtual machine used by Pharo, Squeak, and Cuis. Features JIT compilation. Developed at OpenSmalltalk project. See Chapter 2.

**Collection**
A general term for objects that hold multiple other objects. Includes `Array`, `OrderedCollection`, `Set`, `Dictionary`, `Bag`. See Chapter 6.

**Comment**
Explanatory text enclosed in double quotes `" "`. Ignored by the interpreter. Example: `"This is a comment"`. See Chapter 3.

**Compiler**
The part of Smalltalk that translates source code into bytecode. Accessible as an object - you can customize it! See Chapter 16.

**Cuis Smalltalk**
A minimalist, elegant Smalltalk implementation focused on simplicity and understandability. Created by Juan Vuletich. See Chapter 30.

## D

**Debugger**
An interactive tool for examining and fixing code while it's running. One of Smalltalk's most powerful features - you can modify code in a paused program! See Chapter 21.

**Dictionary**
A collection that maps keys to values. Like a phone book or hash map. Created with `Dictionary new`. Example: `dict at: 'name' put: 'Alice'`. See Chapter 6.

**Do It**
Execute selected code in the current context. Keyboard shortcut: `Ctrl+D` (or `Cmd+D` on Mac). Fundamental way to run code in Smalltalk. See Chapter 3.

**Dolphin Smalltalk**
A Windows-only Smalltalk implementation with excellent Windows integration. Open source. See Chapter 30.

**Double Dispatch**
A design pattern using two polymorphic calls to achieve behavior based on two objects' types. Common in Smalltalk for operations like arithmetic with mixed types. See Chapter 23.

**Duck Typing**
"If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck." In Smalltalk, objects are compatible if they respond to the needed messages, regardless of their class. See Chapter 23.

**Dynamic Typing**
Variables don't have declared types; any variable can hold any object. Types are checked at runtime, not compile time. Fundamental to Smalltalk's flexibility. See Chapter 7.

## E

**Encapsulation**
Hiding an object's internal state and requiring interaction through methods. Instance variables are private; access through accessor methods. See Chapter 13.

**ESUG**
European Smalltalk User Group. Organizes the main annual Smalltalk conference. Active community, great conference videos on YouTube. See Chapter 38.

**Exception**
An object representing an error or unusual condition. Can be signaled, caught, handled, resumed, or retried. Example: `Error`, `ZeroDivide`. See Chapter 24.

**Explorer**
A tool for navigating object structures, especially nested collections. Like a file browser but for objects. See Chapter 20.

## F

**File-out**
Saving code from the image to a file. Historical term. Replaced by modern version control with Tonel. See Chapter 17.

**Fork**
Create a new process (lightweight thread) that runs concurrently. Example: `[ expensive computation ] fork`. See Chapter 37.

## G

**Garbage Collection**
Automatic memory management. The system finds and reclaims objects no longer referenced. You never manually free memory in Smalltalk. See Chapter 16.

**Implementors**
A tool that finds all methods with a given name across the entire system. Example: find all implementations of `+`. Keyboard: `Ctrl+M`. See Chapter 22.

**Inheritance**
When a class inherits behavior from a parent class (superclass). The subclass gets all methods and instance variables of the superclass. Example: `String` inherits from `Collection`. See Chapter 15.

**Initialize**
A conventional method name for setting up a new object's initial state. Automatically called after `new`. See Chapter 13.

**Inspect It**
Execute code and open an inspector on the result. Keyboard: `Ctrl+I` (or `Cmd+I`). Essential for exploring objects. See Chapter 3.

**Inspector**

**Protocol**
A group of related methods in a class. Used for organization, not enforcement. Example: `accessing`, `testing`, `private`. See Chapter 12.

**Reflection**
The ability of a program to examine and modify itself at runtime. Smalltalk is highly reflective - everything is accessible. See Chapter 16.

**Return**
To exit a method and provide a result. Uses the caret `^`. Example: `^ 42`. Methods without explicit return automatically return `self`. See Chapter 12.

## S

**Selector**
The name of a message/method. Example: `size`, `at:`, `ifTrue:ifFalse:`. Can be represented as a symbol like `#size`. See Chapter 4.

**Self**
A pseudo-variable referring to the receiver of the current message. "This object." Example: `self name` calls the `name` method on this object. See Chapter 14.

**Senders**
A tool that finds all places where a particular message is sent. Example: find everywhere that sends `+`. Keyboard: `Ctrl+N`. See Chapter 22.

**Set**
An unordered collection with no duplicates. Like mathematical sets. Example: `Set with: 1 with: 2 with: 2` contains only `1` and `2`. See Chapter 6.

**Singleton**
A design pattern where a class has exactly one instance. Example: `true`, `false`, and `nil` are singletons. See Chapter 36.

**Superclass**
The parent class in an inheritance hierarchy. Example: `Collection` is the superclass of `Array`, `Set`, etc. See Chapter 15.

**Symbol**
An immutable, unique string used as an identifier. Created with `#`. Example: `#name`. Only one `#name` symbol exists in memory. See Chapter 5.

A development methodology: write test first (red), make it pass (green), improve code (refactor). Invented by Kent Beck in Smalltalk! See Chapter 25.

**Template Method**
A design pattern where a superclass defines an algorithm's structure, and subclasses fill in specific steps. Common in Smalltalk. See Chapter 36.
